                <p>PET bottles, which make up 25% of dumpsite space, have an incredibly slow decomposition rate of 500 to 1000 years. Furthermore, Africa and Asia together contribute 90% of the world's ocean plastic waste, while Africa, despite producing only 6% of global plastic, imports 70% of the plastic consumed, highlighting the region's struggle with circularity and mismanagement of plastic waste.</p>

                    <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                </div>
                <div className="container container-md services-content">
                    <p>PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) bottles are made
                        from non-renewable fossil fuels and take hundreds
                        of years to decompose if not properly recycled.
                        Improper disposal of PET bottles contributes to
                        pollution of land, water bodies, and marine
                        ecosystems. Recycling these bottles reduces the
                        need for new plastic production and helps conserve
                        resources.</p>

                <div className="container container-md services-content">
                    <p>Recycling PET bottles significantly reduces energy
                        consumption compared to producing new bottles
                        from raw materials. The recycling process requires
                        less energy, as the collected bottles are melted
                        down and reprocessed into new products. This helps
                        to conserve energy resources and reduce
                        greenhouse gas emissions associated with
                        manufacturing processes.</p>

                    <p>Recycling PET bottles allows for the recovery and
                        reuse of valuable resources, such as petroleum and
                        natural gas. By recycling, we can reduce the
                        extraction and consumption of these limited
                        resources, preserving them for future generations.
                        Additionally, recycling PET bottles reduces the
                        demand for other raw materials used in bottle
                        production, such as water and minerals.</p>

                    <p>PET bottles make up a significant portion of
                        municipal solid waste worldwide. By recycling these
                        bottles, we can divert them from landfills and
                        incinerators, reducing the volume of waste and the
                        associated environmental and health impacts.
                        Recycling also helps to alleviate the strain on waste
                        management systems and promotes a more
                        sustainable waste management approach.</p>
